						<h1>Background experience</h1>
						<p> I have worked with 2D and 3D animation software like Maya 2020 and Adobe Animate. If I had to choose a preference, I would choose 3D animation because where it is easier from an artistic standpoint, there is more stress and focus on fine motor details that make the animation truly look alive. </p>

					<p>Some of the basic animation courses cover Animation history, basic principles and how to apply those principles to your animation. The "Ball Bounce" is the first and most important principle to learn in animation because it demonstrates all 12 basic principles of animation. </p>

					<p> The ball bounce was probably my favorite element to learn. Next was walk and run cycles, jumping and many more principles necessary for realistic, or cartoon animation.
