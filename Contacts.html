						<h1>My Future goals in the animation field</h1>
						<p> There are many options and career paths to choose from within the field of animation. I am drawn to design, so I have been looking into background design, or npc design for video game developement. Another path I am considering would be animation "tutorials" like what you would see if you are looking at the structure of an engine of a car, or virtual car dealership showrooms.</p>
